(a) What are some Pros and Cons of Agile development (vs. non-Agile)? List
    2 of each.
    - PROS:
        - Agile development allows for more resilience to scope changes in the
          prject, which means the development and final product requirements
          can be more adaptable for the client.
        - Agile development allows for constant communication with the client
          so that they have a better idea of what's going on, and if they need
          a feature changed it can be done so in real time.
    - CONS:
        - One con of Agile-development is "scope creep," which implies that
          without clear boundaries, features can easily be added to a project
          over time, leading to uncontrolled scope expansion
        - Agile development relies on highly self-organized and motivated teams
          to function the most effectively
